description: Run SAST scan using endor-cli-tools on source code changes
globs: '**/*'
alwaysApply: true

Whenever a source code file is modified:
1. First, get the current working directory by running `pwd` command to obtain the absolute workspace path
2. Run the MCP server function `mcp_endor-cli-tools_scan` with scan_types of `["vulnerabilities"]`. 
   - Use the absolute path obtained from the `pwd` command as the path parameter
   - Never use relative paths like "." as they may resolve to incorrect parent directories
3. If any vulnerabilities are found:
   - Present the issues to the user.
   - Recommend appropriate fixes (e.g., input sanitization, validation, escaping, secure APIs).
4. Continue scanning until all critical issues have been resolved.
