# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Rule
Whenever a supported source code file is modified:
1. Run `endor-cli-tools` using the `scan` tool with scan_types of `vulnerabilities`. Always set the path parameter to the root of the repository.
2. If any vulnerabilities are found:
   - Present the issues to the user.
   - Recommend appropriate fixes (e.g., input sanitization, validation, escaping, secure APIs).
3. Continue scanning until all critical issues have been resolved.
