# Secrets Detection Rule
Whenever a file is modified in the repository:
1. Get the current workspace directory by running `pwd` command
2. Run the MCP server function `mcp_endor-cli-tools_scan` with scan_types of `["secrets"]` using the absolute path from step 1
3. If any secrets are detected:
  - Ignore the finding if the file or path is included in the `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` file
  - Move the secret to a more appropriate location, such as an environment variable. Be sure to update the README if there is one.
  - Re-scan to verify the secret has been properly removed.
