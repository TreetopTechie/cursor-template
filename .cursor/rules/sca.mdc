# Software Composition Analysis Rule
Whenever you add or modify a dependency in any of the manifest files:
1. Run `endor-cli-tools` using the `check_dependency_for_vulnerabilities` tool.
2. Provide the **language**, **dependency name**, and **version**.
3. If the tool identifies a vulnerability:
  - Upgrade to the suggested safe version
At the **end of every agent session**:
1. Run `endor-cli-tools` using the `scan` tool with scan_types of `dependencies` and set the path parameter to the root of the repository.
2. If any findings are returned:
  - Review and fix each issue using the upgrade advice.
  - Ask the user to re-test their application to make sure the upgrades were successful.
