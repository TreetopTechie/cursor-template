# Software Composition Analysis Rule
Whenever you add or modify a dependency in any of the manifest files:
1. Run the MCP server function `mcp_endor-cli-tools_check_dependency_for_vulnerabilities`.
2. Provide the **ecosystem** (e.g., "pypi", "npm"), **dependency name**, and **version**.
3. If the tool identifies a vulnerability:
  - Upgrade to the suggested safe version
At the **end of every agent session**:
1. Get the absolute workspace path by running `pwd` command
2. Run the MCP server function `mcp_endor-cli-tools_scan` with scan_types of `["dependencies"]` using the absolute path from step 1
3. If any findings are returned:
  - Review and fix each issue using the upgrade advice.
  - Ask the user to re-test their application to make sure the upgrades were successful.
